## What's this?

Impossible PixelArt is a small project made for Recurse Center's SP'23 Impossible Day by Andy Tran and Sunni Raleigh. It explores and utilizes HTML's [canvas api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API).

The project is currently deployed [here](https://merlins-gallery.netlify.app/). Explore a [Goodnight Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodnight_Moon) inspired pixel painting gallery made for pixelized Merlin (Andy's dog). Use your arrow keys to move Merlin around the room; view a painting, move a painting, and maybe steal(?!?) a painting.

Have fun being little virtual merlin and enjoy the art!
